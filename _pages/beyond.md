# Beyond

## The Wandering Roboticist

Beyond tech, this is a journey of travel, curiosity, and figuring out life. Exploring new places, meeting different people, and reflecting on the path ahead inspires me every day. Through this adventure, I share stories, insights, and projects that capture the spirit of discovery.

## Sidequests

My sidequests are where I find balance and inspiration outside of the tech world. I’m passionate about dance, enjoy exploring nature through hiking, and challenge myself with marathon running. These hobbies fuel my creativity and resilience.
