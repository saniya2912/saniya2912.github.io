Developed a **privacy-preserving, local LLM–powered wellbeing assistant** integrated with an iPad to analyze handwritten
journal entries, infer user mood, and store structured insights in a SQLite database for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**–based journaling insights.
Additionally, implemented a **context-aware outfit recommendation pipeline** that combines real-time weather data,
inferred emotional state from journal analysis, and a self-curated, annotated personal wardrobe dataset.

GalPal.ai demonstrates a fully local, privacy-first wellbeing assistant that transforms handwritten journal entries
into structured emotional insights. The system integrates on-device LLM inference, mood classification, and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide reflective summaries and personalized recommendations. Contextual
outfit suggestions are generated by combining inferred emotional state, real-time weather data, and a
user-curated wardrobe knowledge base—showcasing how multimodal personal context can drive meaningful,
assistive intelligence without relying on cloud-based data sharing.
