This project presents a novel optimized control strategy for achieving quadruped stability under unforeseen external disturbances. By leveraging Centroidal Dynamics and the Momentum Jacobian Matrix (MJM), the approach uses eigenvalue analysis to optimize control for enhanced stability. A new term, Effective Disturbance Ratio (EDR), is introduced to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones. The control law is tested on a quadruped standing on flat and inclined surfaces, with Center of Mass (CoM) motion analysis showing the effectiveness of the approach.
