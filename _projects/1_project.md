Developing a dynamic sequential grasping strategy for the robotic LEAP hand, utilizing pinch and power grasps, enabling object
transfer between these grasps, and determining the optimal order for picking the objects.

Despite an extensive body of work on robot grasping, there are numerous routine human grasping skills that are still out of grasp of robots. One such common skill employed by humans is multi-object sequential picking up and grasping. For instance, humans use a combination of pinch grasp with the thumb and forefinger and a power grasp with the palm and remaining fingers to pick up multiple objects.
